## About Me
I'm a passionate Software Developer currently studying Applied Computer Science.  
Driven by my deep aversion for repetitive tasks and enjoyment of building stuff, I started teaching myself how to code in my last year of school (had a lot of free time due to Covid).  
In the last 3 to 4 years, I have worked on many fun coding projects. Sometimes building software I need myself instead of using existing solutions. I have done a lot of mobile app development with Dart & Flutter. I have also often used python for automating annoying tasks, webscraping as well as writing REST APIs with Flask. For data storage I have used MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and Firebase so far.  
At the moment, I am transitioning into Web Development.
